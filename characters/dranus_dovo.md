# Dranus Dovo

## Motivations

Dranus is obsessed with power. He can hide it relatively well but he will do anything to obtain in. Finding and deconstructing magical objects left over by the founders to learn how they worked. He would later use his knowledge to create a vast array of popular magical items that would lead him to becoming the wealthies man on Moko. 

## Personality

He is an exentric billionair who thinks he is always right. 

## Actions

One of very few who can decypher how founder tech works. 

Later uses the wurmcoils to turn anyone against him in the university into magic metal.
