# Dranus Dovo

## Motivations

Dranus is obsessed with power. He can hide it relatively well but he will do anything to obtain in. Finding and deconstructing magical objects left over by the founders to learn how they worked. He would later use his knowledge to create a vast array of popular magical items that would lead him to becoming the wealthiest man on Moko. Originally born in [Vael](../moko/aethos/vael.md) he learned of the [Founders](../races/founders.md)  from an early age and started studying the artifacts around Vael to see what he could learn.

## Personality

He is an eccentric billionaire who thinks he is always right.

## Buisness
First major invention was a way to make customizable enchanted weapons. Can swap out enchantments packs to change the weapon to the users need. Gain a fortune from this idea and used it to build his company. To make one of these enchantment packs two things are needed, a small amount of magic metal to allow the weapon to conduct the magic and a source for the enchantment.

Another notable invention is the magical barrier. Dranus was able to figure out how a founder artifact worked and was able to produce the artifact from breaking down other artifacts. A magical barrier prevents magical energy from moving through.

Null Field - Prevents all magical energy in a spherical zone

## Actions

One of very few who can de-cypher how founder tech works.

Starts his company by buying stolen [Founder](../races/founders.md) artifacts from The Pirate King of [Raxmar](../moko/aethos/raxmar.md)

iLater uses the fangwurms to turn anyone against him in the university into magic metal.
