# Mysthaven

## Overview

Mysthaven is home to the [blood elves](../../races/blood_elves.md), they rarely leave the country due to their sensitivity to light. The country is mostly dense forests filled with mist. There are some large cities that the blood elves live in but are very hard to find unless you know where you are going. It is rumored that the mist is magical and will drive non elves mad. 

One of the largest cities Orm, is the only city that the Vallerains have found. It has been burned to the ground. 

## Government

Democratic Council makes decisions. Each City has a few council members
