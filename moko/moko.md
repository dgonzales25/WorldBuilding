## Continents
 
 - Continent that contains [Hexguard](hexguard/hexguard.md)
 - Blood Elves vs Paladins - a continent locked in war. The mages supply the Paladins with weapons and the druids support the blood elves
 - Druids - one with nature. Their cities are hidden but they are magnificent blends of nature and cities. The druids know that the magic metal is made from the souls of people. Distrust the Mages and Paladins because of their fascination with magic metal
 - Mountains
