# Void

## Overview

The Void is a continent with seemingly nothing and is mostly desert. This is one of the first places the [Founders](../../races/founders.md) tested the Wurmcoils on. They completely decimated the ecosystem and killed all living magical creatures. With the lack of natural predators insects have taken over this continent.
