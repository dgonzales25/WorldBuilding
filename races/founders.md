# The Founders

## Overview

The Founders are a ancient race who had no innate magical ability. They used their extremely intelligence and ingenuity to give themselves eternal life at the cost of others. They harvested the magical power of creatures on the other worlds in the solar system to create Magic Metal. The magic metal was used to create batteries to power themselves. They used the fangwurms to extract magical power from living beings. They created teleporters linking the planets in the solar system so their fangwurms would have a greater feeding ground.

## Downfall

An celestial emp killed all Founders since they became reliant on their machines to stay alive. Only those under water at the time of the emp were able to survive but their society was destroyed. 

The few remain founders and fangwurms on their homeworld died since they had no way to fix the teleporters on the other planets and ran out of magic metal to make batteries. They replaced the batteries of the teleporters on their homeworld but never got the other planets reconnected.
