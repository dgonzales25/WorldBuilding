# Blood Elves

## Overview

Blood elves are an offshoot of the greater race of elves. They are vampiric and feed off the blood of other living creatures. After feeding they gain a burst of magical power because they can draw the magical energy out of the blood they drank. Because they are vampiric they are feared by most other races even though most Blood elf societies have made it illegal to feed of humanoids. Due to their sensitivity to light they are rarely seen outside their home [Mysthaven](../moko/dorath/mysthaven.md)

Their cities are hidden but they are magnificent blends of nature and cities. The elves know that the magic metal is made from the souls of people. Distrust the Mages and Paladins because of their fascination with magic metal

## War

The Vallerians are a holy society that live on the same continent as the blood elves and have started a holy war to eradicate them.
