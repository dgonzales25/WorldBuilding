# Magic

## Overview

Magic in this world is energy. There is no creating or destroying material. Can't just make fire appear there needs to be a source. However this can be used to incorporate different elements or used to make attacks stronger or weaker. Putting magical energy into fire will make it burn hotter and bigger. Takes magical stamina to do things for a long time or learn how to channel energy quickly. So levitating a small object is easy but levitating a city is impossible. 

## Processing

The processing of this magical power comes from breathing. Similar to oxygen the lungs are able to pull out magical energy from the air. Blood store this magical energy. Using magic takes effort like flexing a muscle since you are extracting the magical energy from you blood. (Can only do it for so long and the more you do it the easier it is to do bigger spells). Creatures may or may no continuously use magic, warriors might swing harder by using magical power but not realize they are using magic. 

## Magic items

Enchanted Magical items will radiate magical energy and slowly lose their magic properties unless
 recharged by something or someone.

Potions are also a magical item that slowly lose their magic potency over time

Items made from [magic metal](magic_metal.md) will not lose their magical ability

## Magic system

Players can gain a certain amount of magical power (MP). Spells and abilities cost MP. MP returns when a player rests.
