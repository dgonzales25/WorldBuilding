# Magic

## Source

Many creatures can harness the magical powers around them. In the air is magical power from the environment. Magics that match the type relating to the surrounding are stronger and easier to cast where opposite magics are harder and weaker (Ice magic is easier in the arctic where fire is harder). 

## Processing

The processing of this magical power comes from breathing. Similar to oxygen the lungs are able to pull out magical energy from the air. Blood store this magical energy. Using magic takes effort like flexing a muscle since you are extracting the magical energy from you blood. (Can only do it for so long and the more you do it the easier it is to do bigger spells). Creatures may or may no continuously use magic, warriors might swing harder by using magical power but not realize they are using magic. 

## Magic items

Enchanted Magical items will radiate magical energy and slowly lose their magic properties unless recharged by something or someone.

Potions are also a magical item that slowly lose their magic potency over time

Items made from [magic metal](magic_metal.md) will not lose their magical ability
