# Magic Metal

## What is it
Magic metal is the purest form of condensed magical energy. To create magic metal you must compress organic magical material under immense pressure and heat (similar to compressing carbon into diamond). It will slowly lose its magical properties but much slower than all other forms. 

## Forging
Magic metal can be combined with other non magical metals to dilute it but can not be combined with metals that have a different magic metal source. This means that large chunks of magic metal are extremely valuable since the size of pure magic metal can not be increased.  

## History
Magic metal was invented by [The Founders](../races/founders.md) in their quest for eternal life. It can be found naturally in fossils and in the ground but it is extremely rare. since it requires a magical being to die in a way that they don't decompose.
