# Elements

Each element has some resistance to magical energy and magical properties

## Earth

Earth is the one element that is magically inert. It has a high magical resistance. Most spells that interact with earth move it around.

## Water

Water can be a source of magical energy by making it colder or slower. Once it becomes ice no more magical energy can be pulled from it. It can also be a sink for magical energy by making it hot. Medium resistance.

## Fire

Pulling magic from fire will make it colder and if too much is pulled the fire will go out. Putting energy into fire will make it hotter and bigger. Fire has the lowest magical resistance of any element making it one of the most standard introductory magic elements.

## Air

Air behaves very similar to water however it has a medium high resistance.

## Light



## Flora
## Fauna
