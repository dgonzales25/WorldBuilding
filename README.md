A [magical universe](misc/magic.md). Everyone is born with magical power some can willingly tap into it others passively use it (barbarians, fighters) it can be trained to grow more powerful. 

[The Founders](races/founders.md) a race of organic machine hybrids ruled the solar system. Thousands of years ago they would harvest people and animals to extract their magic into metal using Fangwurms.
