# Fangwurms

## Overview

Fangwurms are worm-like creatures that hunt based on magical sight. Fangwurm crushes organic matter so hard that only the solid magical energy remainings. This [magic metal](../misc/magic_metal.md) becomes part of the fangwurm and the fangwurm gets some magical properties of the source of the magic.
